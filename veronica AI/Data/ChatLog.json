He was born around 1162 AD in Mongolia and united various Mongol tribes to create a powerful empire under his leadership. He is known for his military campaigns, which expanded the empire across a vast territory, including parts of China, Central Asia, Eastern Europe, and the Middle East. Genghis Khan is also famous for his code of laws, known as the \"Yassa,\" which emphasized loyalty, discipline, and justice. He died in 1227 AD, and his legacy continues to shape the history of the regions he conquered."
